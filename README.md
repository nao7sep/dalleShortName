# dalleShortName

Currently (meaning January 2024), you'd get DALL-E generated images as files named like "DALL·E 2024-01-05 15.44.53 - A whimsical and surreal wide-format illustration of snowy Moscow, featuring bears drinking vodka. The scene is set in a snowy landscape with iconic Mo.png" with a special symbol in the beginning and the following excessively redundant part.

dalleShortName renames them to simple names like "DALL-E 2024-01-05 15.44.53.png" that are just enough to be distinguished from each other containing only ASCII characters.

If you later need the original file names, refer to the log file (dalleShortName.log) that at first doesnt exist and will be generated once the first file is renamed. It will be next to the app's executable file (dalleShortName.exe).

To run the app, download the latest ZIP archive from the following place, extract it, open the App directory and double-click on the executable file. You might need to first install .NET 6.0 to run the app. .NET 6.0 is available for free.
